# Dabble Of Color

WordPress theme created and designed for personal blog  [Apostrophes.us](http://apostrophes.us).   and was build by Jamie Jones. Please respect my work and don't copy snippets of code without credit. I have over a decade plus of experience working with WordPress themes and am constantly on the look out for new ways to improve my knowledge on how to create better themes for WordPress. I appreciate any suggestions anyone might have to better this theme or to help me learn new tricks to make WordPress themes load faster and less bloated and what I want it to do for myself. So please, let me know if you have anything that you might find interesting for me to learn.!

## Version 1.0 Dabble Of Color

(http://apostrophes.us/updated-design-consideration-to-dabble-of-colors/) [Release date: January 19, 2018](http://apostrophes.us/)

Dabble of color is a design I created due to being inspired by an acquaintance's color scheme she used on an old theme of hers. This theme originally had another look and feel to it, but it wasn't making me happy. Again, I'm always looking for new tricks and tips to improve my knowledge of creating faster loading WordPress themes. If you have any, please let me know!
